    selection:
      "Selection Sort repeatedly scans the unsorted portion of the array to find the smallest element before placing it into its final position. Although it performs fewer swaps than Bubble Sort, it still requires quadratic time for almost every input.",

    insertion:
      "Insertion Sort builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. It performs exceptionally well on nearly sorted data, achieving linear time in the best case while remaining simple, stable, and in-place.",

    merge:
      "Merge Sort always divides the array into smaller halves before merging them back together. Unlike Bubble or Insertion Sort, its running time remains O(n log n) regardless of the input order.",
    
     quick:
      "Quick Sort partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the resulting subarrays. It delivers excellent average-case performance, though poor pivot choices can degrade it to O(n²).",
